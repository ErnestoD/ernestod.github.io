	Born and raised in Japan with his family, which consists of his father, <u>Soichiro Yagami</u>, 
	who is a member of the Japanese Task Force (an investigation team opposing the terrorist Kira), 
	his mother, <u>Sachiko Yagami</u>, and his younger sister, <u>Sayu Yagami</u>.<br><br>
	Mr. Yagami has been noted as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. He would constantly predict all of the possible 
	scenarios that could happen and plan a solution in advance, even in the most impromptu situations.<br><br>
	Being frustrated by the lack of justice in the world, his main goal is to create a new world that is free of injustice and populated only with honest and kind people.
