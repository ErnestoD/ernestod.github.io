					<h2><u>State 1</u></h2>					
					<div class="ui-grid-c ui-responsive">
					  <div class="ui-block-a">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Colorado</a><br>
						<span>Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, ranging from alpine mountains, arid plains and deserts with huge sand dunes, deep canyons, sandstone and granite rock formations, rivers, lakes, and lush forests.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-b">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Denver</a><br>
						<span>Denver is located in the center of the Front Range Urban Corridor, between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the High Plains to the east. Denver's topography consists of plains in the city center with hilly areas to the north, west and south.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-c">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Lark Bunting</a><br>
						<span>Lark buntings are small songbirds, with a short, thick, bluish bill.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-d">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Rocky Mountain Columbine</a><br>
						<span>There is some confusion as to which species of columbine is the official state flower of Colorado. The original documents referred to the state flower as being lavender and white in color and not of a particular species.</span>
					  </div>  
					</div>
					
					<h2><u>State 2</u></h2>
					<div class="ui-grid-c ui-responsive">
					  <div class="ui-block-a">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Georgia</a><br>
						<span>Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the Ridge and Valley, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-b">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Atlanta</a><br>
						<span>Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been particularly "southern"—because Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a patrician southern seaport like Savannah or Charleston, many of the city's landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-c">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Brown Thrasher</a><br>
						<span>The brown thrasher is an omnivore, with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species as large as humans</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-d">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Cherokee Rose</a><br>
						<span>The flower is commonly associated with the Trail of Tears, the forced relocation of Native Americans in the southeastern United States. Its white petals are said to represent the tears the Cherokee women shed during the period of great hardship and grief throughout US government-forced march from the Cherokees' home to U.S. forts, such as Gilmer. The flower's gold center is said to symbolize the gold taken from the Cherokee tribe.</span>
					  </div>  
					</div>
					
					<h2><u>State 3</u></h2>
					<div class="ui-grid-c ui-responsive">
					  <div class="ui-block-a">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">North Carolina</a><br>
						<span>So many ships have been lost off Cape Hatteras that the area is known as the "Graveyard of the Atlantic"; more than 1,000 ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the Queen Anne's Revenge (flagship of the pirate Blackbeard), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-b">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Raleigh</a><br>
						<span>Raleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city, chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-c">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Northern Cardinal</a><br>
						<span>The northern cardinal has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female. The male is a vibrant red, while the female is a dull reddish olive.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-d">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Flowering Dogwood</a><br>
						<span>When in the wild they can typically be found at the forest edge and frequently on dry ridges. While most of the wild trees have white bracts, some selected cultivars of this tree also have pink bracts, some even almost a true red.</span>
					  </div>  
					</div>
					
					<h2><u>State 4</u></h2>
					<div class="ui-grid-c ui-responsive">
					  <div class="ui-block-a">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">South Carolina</a><br>
						<span>Earthquakes do occur in South Carolina. The greatest frequency is along the central coastline of the state, in the Charleston area. South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude 3.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-b">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Columbia</a><br>
						<span>Columbia is the capital of and largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, with a population of 129,272 as of the 2010 United States Census.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-c">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Carolina Wren</a><br>
						<span>There are seven recognized subspecies across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-d">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Yellow Jessamine</a><br>
						<span>All parts of this plant contain the toxic strychnine-related alkaloids gelsemine and gelseminine and should not be consumed. The sap may cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals. Children, mistaking this flower for honeysuckle, have been poisoned by sucking the nectar from the flower.</span>
					  </div>  
					</div>
					
					<h2><u>State 5</u></h2>
					<div class="ui-grid-c ui-responsive">
					  <div class="ui-block-a">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Wyoming</a><br>
						<span>Wyoming is the 10th most extensive, but the least populous and the second least densely populated of the 50 United States.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-b">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Cheyenne</a><br>
						<span>is the capital and most populous city of the US state of Wyoming and the county seat of Laramie County. It is the principal city of the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Metropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of Laramie County. The population was 59,466 at the 2010 census.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-c">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Western Meadowlark</a><br>
						<span>Adults have yellow underparts, with a black "V" on the breast, and white flanks which are streaked with black. Their upper parts are mostly brown, but also have black streaks. These birds have long pointed bills and their heads are striped with light brown and black.</span>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ui-block-d">
						<a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-shadow">Indian Paintbrush</a><br>
						<span>The flowers of Indian paintbrush are edible, and were consumed in moderation by various Native American tribes as a condiment with other fresh greens. These plants have a tendency to absorb and concentrate selenium in their tissues from the soils in which they grow, and can be potentially very toxic if the roots or green parts of the plant are consumed.</span>
